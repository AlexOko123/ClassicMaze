This project is a Java-based simulation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game, recreated as a standalone program for learning, experimentation, and fun. The simulation includes core mechanics such as player movement, ghost AI, dot collection, and basic collision detectionâ€”all built from scratch using standard Java libraries.

The game is rendered in a 2D grid using Javaâ€™s Swing and AWT libraries, allowing for a simple but interactive graphical user interface. Keyboard controls let you navigate Pac-Man through the maze while avoiding ghosts and collecting pellets. If a ghost catches Pac-Man, the game ends. If all pellets are eaten, you win!
